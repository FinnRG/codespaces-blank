            "challenge-1-title": "Use recycled paper",
            "challenge-1-content": "You probably already know that recycled paper is extremely environmentally friendly. However, it should be emphasized again: on average, 0.21 liters of water are saved per sheet through reusing instead of new production. As far as the required energy is concerned, there is a very clear effect here in large quantities. So, with a single decision to recycle paper, you can have multiple beneficial impacts - one more item on your list!",
            "challenge-2-title": "Picking up food with your own lunchbox",
            "challenge-2-content": "If you pick up your lunch instead of having it delivered, consider bringing your own lunch box! By doing this, you reduce energy and water consumption. ToGo packaging and pizza boxes, which weigh an average of around 70g, even if these are made from cardboard, cost a lot of water to produce. And of course it's even worse for the environment when aluminum packaging is used. No matter what you decide - You can contribute your part!",
            "challenge-3-title": "Buy fruit without wrapping",
            "challenge-3-content": "Why does it make sense to rely on peel for your fruit? Many people agree that there is no need to individually wrap apples, bananas or oranges in plastic. This not only creates waste, but also produces additional CO2 and uses more energy, which are required for plastic production. While recycling is good, it's better to avoid waste. Fortunately, more and more supermarkets are already using plastic-free packaging and the best way is of course to do without packaging altogether. Here's a tip for you: Buy or make reusable fruit and vegetable nets that you can take with you when you go shopping!",
            "challenge-4-title": "Only print necessary pages",
            "challenge-4-content": "Some people just work better on paper - are you one of them? Then you can still easily save a lot of paper! If you are handing out longer documents, why don’t you try to not print everything, but only the pages that you really need? You can check off one point for every two pages that you save. Easy!",
            "challenge-5-title": "Store via Shop a Tree",
            "challenge-5-content": "Important note in advance - The following applies to online consumption: Avoidance is better than compensation! Store a Tree and Klimashopper are both intermediary platforms to many online stores. They receive commission when you buy through their site, and invest about 80% of it in climate protection and reforestation projects. reforestation projects. How many trees are planted or how much CO2 is compensa- offset depends on the partner store and on the value of your wa value - but you can expect to save an average of 5 trees or 25kg of CO2 for a purchase of more than 50€ can be assumed.",
            "challenge-6-title": "Vegan lunch",
            "challenge-6-content": "From an ecological perspective, adopting a vegan diet (one that excludes animal products) is undoubtedly the best choice. Compared to a mixed diet, a vegetarian diet saves around 660kg CO2 per year, while a vegan diet can save up to 1,000kg CO2. Therefore, it is definitely worth trying vegan food from time to time. For instance, a doner kebab generates 4.2kg of CO2 emissions per serving, whereas the falafel alternative only produces 2.5kg CO2 emissions. On average, it is assumed that each meal generates 4kg CO2 emissions. However, the savings compared to a primarily meat-based diet can be even greater! It's worth noting that, compared to a vegetarian diet, the water savings with a vegan diet may not necessarily be significantly greater, since there is also a lot of water involved in producing foods such as rice.",
            "challenge-7-title": "Unplug computer after use",
            "challenge-7-content": "A computer in stand-by mode consumes on average 3 watt-hours of energy. That might not sound like much but after a weekend in which the computer is in standby mode, it would already increase to 189 watt-hours. So switch off the computer (and/or multi-outlet) completely if you will not be using it for a longer period of time to save energy.",
            "challenge-8-title": "Margarine instead of butter",
            "challenge-8-content": "Using margarine instead of butter has many advantages for the environment, as margarine production produces only 13.5kg of CO2 per kilogram of product. Conventional butter already leads to 24kg of CO2 per kilogram of butter. That is a significant difference. So leave butter and give magarine a chance!",
            "challenge-9-title": "Mobile phone in energy-saving mode",
            "challenge-9-content": "Did you know that your smartphone in energy-saving mode uses only about 70% of the energy of the normal mode? With an annual consumption of about 3.9 kilowatts per hour, smartphones may not be the biggest energy consumers but it does not hurt to reduce avoidable power consumption.",
            "challenge-10-title": "Fabric bag for food transportation",
            "challenge-10-content": "Some supermarkets are now fortunately using reusable (paper) bags instead of plastic bags due to legal requirements. Unfortunately, many shops around the corner have not yet picked up on this trend, and still use the old plastic bags. But thanks to your help, this can be changed: When you go out to buy goods, just take your own reusable with you! We recommend cloth bags.",
            "challenge-11-title": "Switch off light at brightness",
            "challenge-11-content": "Who hasn't experienced this: It is lunchtime; the sun is shining into your room and suddenly you notice that your lamp has been stubbornly fighting the daylight for the last three hours. Of course, the length of the day differs significantly between summer and winter. Nevertheless: In many rooms, lamps burn for hours every day even though not needed at all because of the daylight. Based on an average energy consumption of 0.25 kilowatts per hour and about six hours a day though the lamps definitely do not need to be active, so: raise the blinds and turn off the lights!",
            "challenge-12-title": "Get your smartphone at Refurbed",
            "challenge-12-content": "Do you always have to have brand new devices, or is a good as new one enough for you? Refurbed offers you the opportunity to purchase service equipment that has already been used and repaired so that it is now in good as new condition - and at a much lower price. Like this, the circular economy is furthered! Refurbed states that by purchasing a device that has already been used, up to 70% of the emissions caused by the production of a new device can be saved. According to the company, that's 43kg of CO2 for one smartphone alone. You also save energy, water consumption, and electronic waste by reusing like this.",
            "challenge-13-title": "Reduce heating by one degree",
            "challenge-13-content": "It's difficult, but it's worth it: every degree less in heating can mean a saving of around 6%! Every week in which you convince your colleagues, you can save around 8.3 kWh of energy and 2.96 kg of CO2. Since gas consumption is measured in kWh and is often high, the numbers are not easy to confuse.",
            "challenge-14-title": "Choose reusable cutlery",
            "challenge-14-content": "Disposable plastic cutlery has been banned in the meantime - However, with many delivery services we still use the still use the supplied - biodegradable, but often in the biodegradable, but often end up in the residual waste and still and still causing mill and emissions. disposable forks and knives. Much better: keep a set of cutlery in the coffee cupboard and use it again and again! and use them again and again! This saves waste and and emissions every time you have lunch!",
            "challenge-15-title": "Track your activity with Active Giving",
            "challenge-15-content": "Active Giving is a unique fitness tracking app like Runtastic. It allows you to plant trees by engaging in activities like hiking, running, and biking. This project is financed by partner companies and events. For example, with a 5 km run you can plant two trees. This saves around 10 kg of CO2, assuming a 10% survival rate and a realistic planting potential of 50 kg of CO2 per tree.",
            "challenge-16-title": "Turn off the tap when soaping up",
            "challenge-16-content": "Does it really always have to be water from the water be? Our tap water in Germany is of top drinking water quality - and quenches thirst in exactly the same way just as well as water from plastic or glass bottles. What's more, it's much cleaner and produces no emissions or energy emissions and energy consumption for the production production, nor waste during the (final) disposal of the (reusable) water bottles. (reusable) water bottles! If you don't want to run to the tap for every glass of water to the faucet for every glass, just fill up one water bottle bottle over and over again - and it will even feel exactly as if it was fresh out of the box!",
            "challenge-17-title": "Turn on full dishwasher",
            "challenge-17-content": "One cycle of the dishwasher, even in the economy or eco program, consumes about 11 liters of water and 0.9 kWh of energy. However, in the office, the dishwasher is often only half full, even though most people would not do this at home. This wastes around 50 liters of fresh water per week, which ends up going down the drain. Therefore, it is important to only turn on the dishwasher when it is fully loaded, which will halve the number of rinsing processes needed.",
            "challenge-18-title": "Use packaging as a garbage bag",
            "challenge-18-content": "How much of what we buy or get delivered every day is packaged in some kind of plastic? Unfortunately, a lot. Of course, the best way to avoid waste is to reduce consumption - but if you already have plastic packaging, at least give it a new purpose! You can often use plastic packaging very well as a garbage bag, saving you from producing new plastic bags just for your waste. It's not upcycling, but it's 100% recycling!",
            "challenge-19-title": "Insulate windows",
            "challenge-19-content": "It is, of course, up to the company to properly insulate the windows in its office. However, if it takes too long to get new windows installed, you can help and contribute to saving heating energy. With insulation tape from the DIY store, you can save up to 286kWh of heating energy per year in a 35sqm office, which is equivalent to about 73kg of CO2. It is recommended that you only insulate properly once a year. Note: Gas consumption in kWh is usually much higher than electricity consumption. For example, an average 2-person household consumes 2,180kWh of electricity and 12,000kWh of gas per year. Therefore, you should be careful when estimating the consumption figures.",
            "challenge-20-title": "Ecosia as search engine",
            "challenge-20-content": "Every Google search pollutes the atmosphere with about 0.2g of CO2. May not sound like much, but how much do you google every day? Some unavoidable searches already add up to a considerable amount for each of us. But you can also do something good for the environment with your searches. The search engine Ecosia can help you do this: Ecosia is climate-neutral and invests its profits in the common good - whereby one tree is planted for every 45 search queries.It is difficult to say exactly how much CO2 is saved by planting trees, but it can be assumed that around 50kg of CO2 is saved per day if 10% of the trees survive. With about 20 searches per day, one can assume a saving of about 49kg CO2 as well as 2.5kg saved by planting half a tree. A simple contribution to a clean environment!",
            "challenge-21-title": "Brew only the necessary amount of coffee",
            "challenge-21-content": "A filter machine has an average capacity of around 500-600ml - and from an energy point of view it always makes more sense than a fully automatic machine, which heats the water anew for each cup instead of carrying out the heating process only once. However, it happens very often, especially in work environments, that the first person brews the full 500ml - takes a coffee - and the rest cools down. Half an hour later, the next person doesn't want to drink a cold coffee and the game repeats itself. Rather than energy (less of which is needed for less water), a lot of water is wasted here. Therefore: only brew as much coffee as you really drink! (Or - talk to your colleagues, because the fewer heating processes, the less energy consumption).",
            "challenge-22-title": "Dishwasher instead of manual washing",
            "challenge-22-content": "Even though it may feel different: washing dishes with a machine requires significantly less water than washing them by hand. A normal-sized dishwasher can hold 13 place settings, which can be washed with about 10-13 litres of water - that is 0.5-1 litres per place setting (3 plates, 1 cup, 1 tall glass, fork, knife, spoon). When washing by hand, on the other hand, you waste at least 2-3l, even if the sink is filled and the water is not left running (then it is even 15-20l)!",
            "challenge-23-title": "Only boil necessary water",
            "challenge-23-content": "On average, a kettle has a capacity of 11l. But if you drink, it is not necessary to drink 11 cups of tea or need 11 liters of water to cook a 5-minute terrine, which is both waste and nutritionally inadvisable. Therefore, it is important to only use as much water and energy for cooking as you really need - in this case, one cup of 200ml. It can be as simple as that!",
            "challenge-24-title": "Use residual heat",
            "challenge-24-content": "The oven or ceramic hob does not have to be on full power until the last minute - most of the time it is not necessary to run it on the highest setting for so long. If you use about 4-5 minutes of residual heat when preparing your food or heating up lunch and switch off earlier, you can save a considerable amount of energy every day! In this way, you can easily make a contribution to saving resources.",
            "challenge-25-title": "Bring lunch in Tupperware",
            "challenge-25-content": "Home-cooked food usually tastes best - typically better than the food from the delivery services you often use at lunchtime (except for those who have a canteen available). You also save a lot of waste by avoiding delivery: to-go packaging and pizza boxes weigh around 70g on average, and even if they are made of cardboard, they consume a lot of water in the production process - let alone aluminium packaging.",
            "challenge-26-title": "Water faucet instead of water bottle",
            "challenge-26-content": "Does it really always have to be water from the water jug? Our tap water in Germany is of top drinking water quality and quenches thirst just as well as water from plastic or glass bottles. What's more, it's much cheaper and there are no emissions or energy consumption for production or waste during (reusable) disposal of the water bottles. If you don't want to run to the tap for every glass, just refill a single water bottle over and over again - and it even feels just like it's fresh out of the box!",
            "challenge-27-title": "Use glass instead of disposable cups",
            "challenge-27-content": "A sustainable extra at some water dispensers, but also at many garden parties: glass cups. Unlike a paper cup, making a glass cup doesn't gobble up any water. Plus, glass is much easier to recycle. And even if the glass has to be rinsed: After 10 circulations, it's still more environmentally friendly than its cardboard relative.",
            "challenge-28-title": "Dusting radiators",
            "challenge-28-content": "In a 35 square metre room, an average of 103 kWh of energy must be used to heat it in winter. But you can save up to 10% of the energy consumption if you make sure the heating is dust-free and clean! So take the feather duster and dust it off regularly! Note: Gas consumption (and therefore savings) is also measured in kWh, but it is usually many times higher than electricity consumption. As an example: a two-person household consumes an average of 2,180 kWh of electricity per year, but 12,000 kWh of gas - so don't be confused if the figures are different!",
